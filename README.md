# Boids
The flocking behaviour of birds simulation

## Rules
The rules applied to each Boid are as follows:

- **separation**: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
- **alignment**: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- **cohesion**: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
